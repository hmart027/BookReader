DepthCap.m
	Is used to capture the Lower resolution amplitude data and depth information
	(First the scene of the base only and when prompted with desired book at this point
	the second and separte code and source should be use to caputer the desired book )
DepthCapHres2.m
	Input the low resolution image and high resolution image and this function will allow 	
	you to select and register the images based on common points selected (select 3 		
	points). this will produce a high res raw depth map which should match the HD image
DepthCapHresmod6.m
	This function uses the high res information from DepthCapHres2 to transform the HD 		
	image the resulting image should be the flatten one (The image is reconstructed via 		
	interp2 by using the inverse of the flatening function to determine interger 		
	locations)
DepthCapHresmodext5.m
	This function should be used after DepthCapHresmod6. This funtion will extend the 		
	image based and the height to reconstruct it via triscattered interpolation (you can 	
	select which method of interpolation to use here)
